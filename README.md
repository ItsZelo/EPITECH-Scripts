# EPITECH-Scripts
A bunch of useful scripts for EPITECH students

reposcript :
USAGE : repository [option] [parameters]
Available options are:

	list
	push    [commit_name]
	clone   [repository]
	create  [repository]
	delete  [repository]
	status  [repository]
	deluser [repository] [user]
	adduser [repository] [user] [permissions]
	
The options are self-explanatory (push option is ambiguous, this option stage all the changes and then commit / push)
You should put an 'export EPITECH=firstname.name@epitech.eu' in your init files like .zshrc or .bashrc
This script works with expect to enter the password for you (for security reasons you have to enter it once)
If you don't want to enter your password everytime, you can put your password inside the script in 'PASSWORD="your_password"'
  
  Don't hesitate to report bugs :)
  Enjoy !
